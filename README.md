# Interviewed

A collection of problems (and solutions to them) I found during tech interviews

## General tips

- Know how to calculate complexity (time and space) of everything you do
- Ask as many questions as needed
- Speak out what you are thinking about
- EVERYTHING is about tradeoffs: brute force might be ok in small sets... Know when the brute force complexity will surpass a better approach (e.g. sorting might cost you something, but a sorted input might allow a faster algorithm)

## Questions to ask interviewers

Most interviewers leave some time at some point to let you ask questions. This is both to give you a chance to interview them and for them to asses a bit more how curious/well prepared/thoughtful you are. I really enjoy this section of an interview being on either side of the table. Here are some of my favorite questions (some of them are pretty common, some of them are ones I've developed over the years):

- What do you like the most about working here?
- What do you like the least about working here?
- What can I expect to be doing on day 1, 15, 60, 90, 120?
- How does a project go from idea (where do ideas come from) to successfully being used in production? (Different people will concentrate on different aspects, so this gives you a chance to drill down in anything you might be interested: brainstorming, code reviews, QA environments, CI, CD, testing in production, A/B experiments, etc.)
- If you had a magic wand, what would you change about how your team works?
- What do successful people work here?
- How does incident management look like?
