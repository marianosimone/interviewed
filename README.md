# interviewed

A collection of problems (and solutions to them) I found during tech interviews

## General tips

- Know how to calculate complexity (time and space) of everything you do
- Ask as many questions as needed
- Speak out what you are thinking about
- EVERYTHING is about tradeoffs: brute force might be ok in small sets... Know when the brute force complexity will surpass a better approach (e.g. sorting might cost you something, but a sorted input might allow a faster algorithm)
